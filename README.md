Problem:
Use your array-based ADT to implement a basic **Library Management System** that keeps track of books. The system should allow adding new books, removing books, searching for a book by its index, and displaying the total number of books. - Design a user-friendly interface for interacting with the library, abstracting away the details of the underlying array implementation.

Requirements:
Implement an abstract data type (ADT) using an array as the underlying data structure. This could be a simple List ADT or a more specific ADT like a dynamic array or  ArrayList 
 The ADT should hide the details of the array implementation from the user, providing a clear and abstract interface for interacting with the data. 
Operations to Implement: -
 `add(element)`: Adds an element to the end of the array. - 
`insert(index, element)`: Inserts an element at a specified index, shifting elements as needed. - `remove(index)`: Removes the element at the specified index, shifting elements as needed. - `get(index)`: Returns the element at the specified index. 
`size()`: Returns the number of elements in the array. - 
`isEmpty()`: Returns `True` if the array is empty, otherwise `False`. 
Dynamic Resizing- Enhance your array-based ADT to handle dynamic resizing.
